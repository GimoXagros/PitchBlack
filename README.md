Intro
---

Survival is now far more difficult as the Biters play the relentless alien wildlife truly hellbent on overwhelming you.
Spend your daylight wisely as the biters remain largely dormant unless provoked. But even a daytime provocation is nothing compared to the swarm that awakens at sunset.
Summary

Presently, your first day is bright and will last 2 hours. After that nights will occur lasting roughly 20-40 minutes to 30-40 minutes day time, although days will still be dark.

Biter behavior comes in phases, where they will be more passive during the daytime and become more aggressive at night. Also, their evolution rate will spike during nighttime and diminish during day time.

Keep an eye out for warnings on how to deal with their immediate threat.
